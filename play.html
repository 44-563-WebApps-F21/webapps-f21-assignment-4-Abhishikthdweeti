    <H2>ACT IV.

        SCENE.--_Antechamber of the CZAR'S private room. Large window at the
        back, with drawn curtains over it._
        
        _Present._--PRINCE PETROVITCH, BARON RAFF, MARQUIS DE POIVRARD, COUNT
        ROUVALOFF.
        
        
        PRINCE PETRO. He is beginning well, this young Czar.
        
        BARON RAFF (_shrugs his shoulders_). All young Czars do begin well.
        
        COUNT R. And end badly.
        
        [1]MARQ. DE POIV. Well, I have no right to complain. He has done me one
        good service, at any rate.
        
        PRINCE PETRO. Cancelled your appointment to Archangel, I suppose?
        
        MARQ. DE POIV. Yes; my head wouldn't have been safe there for an
        hour.[1]
        
        (_Enter GENERAL KOTEMKIN._)
        
        BARON RAFF. Ah! General, any more news of our romantic Emperor?
        
        GEN. KOTEMK. You are quite right to call him romantic, Baron; a week ago
        I found him amusing himself in a garret with a company of strolling
        players; to-day his whim is all the convicts in Siberia are to be
        recalled, and political prisoners, as he calls them, amnestied.
        
        PRINCE PETRO. Political prisoners! Why, half of them are no better than
        common murderers!
        
        COUNT R. And the other half much worse?
        
        BARON RAFF. Oh, you wrong them, surely, Count. Wholesale trade has
        always been more respectable than retail.
        
        COUNT R. But he is really too romantic. He objected yesterday to my
        having the monopoly of the salt tax. He said the people had a right to
        have cheap salt.
        
        MARQ. DE POIV. Oh, that's nothing; but he actually disapproved of a
        State banquet every night because there is a famine in the Southern
        provinces. (_The young CZAR enters unobserved, and overhears the rest._)
        
        PRINCE PETRO. Quelle b√©tise! The more starvation there is among the
        people, the better. It teaches them self-denial, an excellent virtue,
        Baron, an excellent virtue.
        
        BARON RAFF. I have often heard so; I have often heard so.
        
        GEN. KOTEMK. He talked of a Parliament, too, in Russia, and said the
        people should have deputies to represent them.
        
        BARON RAFF. As if there was not enough brawling in the streets already,
        but we must give the people a room to do it in. But, Messieurs, the
        worst is yet to come. He threatens a complete reform in the public
        service on the ground that the people are too heavily taxed.
        
        MARQ. DE POIV. He can't be serious there. What is the use of the people
        except[2] to get money out of? But talking of taxes, my dear Baron, you
        must really let me have forty thousand roubles to-morrow? my wife says
        she must have a new diamond bracelet.
        
        COUNT R. (_aside to BARON RAFF_). Ah, to match the one Prince Paul gave
        her last week, I suppose.
        
        PRINCE PETRO. I must have sixty thousand roubles at once, Baron. My son
        is overwhelmed with debts of honour which he can't pay.
        
        BARON RAFF. What an excellent son to imitate his father so carefully!
        
        GEN. KOTEMK. You are always getting money. I never get a single kopeck I
        have not got a right to. It's unbearable; it's ridiculous! My nephew is
        going to be married. I must get his dowry for him.
        
        PRINCE PETRO. My dear General, your nephew must be a perfect Turk. He
        seems to get married three times a week regularly.
        
        GEN. KOT. Well, he wants a dowry to console him.
        
        COUNT R. I am sick of town. I want a house in the country.
        
        MARQ. DE POIV. I am sick of the country. I want a house in town.
        
        BARON RAFF. Mes amis, I am extremely sorry for you. It is out of the
        question.
        
        PRINCE PETRO. But my son, Baron?
        
        GEN. KOTEMK. But my nephew?
        
        MARQ. DE POIV. But my house in town?
        
        COUNT R. But my house in the country?
        
        MARQ. DE POIV. But my wife's diamond bracelet?
        
        BARON RAFF. Gentlemen, impossible! The old _regime_ in Russia is dead;
        the funeral begins to-day.
        
        COUNT R. Then I shall wait for the resurrection.
        
        PRINCE PETRO. Yes, but, _en attendant_, what are we to do?
        
        BARON RAFF. What have we always done in Russia when a Czar suggests
        reforms?--nothing. You forget we are diplomatists. Men of thought should
        have nothing to do with action. Reforms in Russia are very tragic, but
        they always end in a farce.
        
        COUNT R. I wish Prince Paul were here. [3]By the bye, I think this boy
        is rather ungrateful to him. If that clever old Prince had not
        proclaimed him Emperor at once without giving him time to think about
        it, he would have given up his crown, I believe, to the first cobbler he
        met in the street.
        
        PRINCE PETRO. But do you think, Baron, that Prince Paul is really
        going?[3]
        
        BARON RAFF. He is exiled.
        
        PRINCE PETRO. Yes; but is he going?
        
        BARON RAFF. I am sure of it; at least he told me he had sent two
        telegrams already to Paris about his dinner.
        
        COUNT R. Ah! that settles the matter.
        
        CZAR (_coming forward_). Prince Paul better send a third telegram and
        order (_counting them_) six extra places.
        
        BARON RAFF. The devil!
        
        CZAR. No, Baron, the Czar. Traitors! There would be no bad kings in the
        world if there were no bad ministers like you. It is men such as you who
        wreck mighty empires on the rock of their own greatness. Our mother,
        Russia, hath no need of such unnatural sons. You can make no atonement
        now; it is too late for that. The grave cannot give back your dead, nor
        the gibbet your martyrs, but I shall be more merciful to you. I give you
        your lives! That is the curse I would lay on you. But if there is a man
        of you found in Moscow by to-morrow night your heads will be off your
        shoulders.
        
        BARON RAFF. You remind us wonderfully, Sire, of your Imperial father.
        
        CZAR. I banish you all from Russia. Your estates are confiscated to the
        people. You may carry your titles with you. Reforms in Russia, Baron,
        always end in a farce. You will have a good opportunity, Prince
        Petrovitch, of practising self-denial, that excellent virtue! that
        excellent virtue! So, Baron, you think a Parliament in Russia would be
        merely a place for brawling. Well, I will see that the reports of each
        session are sent to you regularly.
        
        BARON RAFF. Sire, you are adding another horror to exile.
        
        CZAR. But you will have such time for literature now. You forget you are
        diplomatists. Men of thought should have nothing to do with action.
        
        PRINCE PETRO. Sire, we did but jest.</H2>
