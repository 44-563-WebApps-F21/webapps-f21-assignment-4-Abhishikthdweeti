    <H2>ACT IV.

        <p class="stage-direction"> SCENE.--_Antechamber of the CZAR'S private room. Large window at the
        back, with drawn curtains over it._
        
        _Present._--PRINCE PETROVITCH, BARON RAFF, MARQUIS DE POIVRARD, COUNT
        ROUVALOFF.</p>
        
        
        <h4 class="name PRINCE-PETRO">PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p class="speech">He is beginning well, this young Czar.</p>
        
        <h4 class="name BARON RAFF">BARON RAFF</h4><p class="stage-direction"></p>
        <p class="stage-direction">(_shrugs his shoulders_).</p>
        <p class="speech">All young Czars do begin well.</p>
        
        <h4 class="name COUNT-RR">COUNT R.</h4><p class="speech"> And end badly.</p>
        
        <h4 class="name MARQ-DE-POIV">MARQ. DE POIV.</h4><p class="speech"> Well, I have no right to complain. He has done me one
        good service, at any rate.</p>
        
        <h4 class="name PRINCE-PETRO">PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p class="speech">Cancelled your appointment to Archangel, I suppose?</p>
        
        <h4 class="name MARQ-DE-POIV "">MARQ. DE POIV.</h4><p class="speech"> Yes; my head wouldn't have been safe there for an
        hour.</p>
        
        <p class="stage-direction">(_Enter GENERAL KOTEMKIN._)</p>
        
        <h4 class="name BARON-RAFF">BARON RAFF.</h4><p class="speech"> Ah! General, any more news of our romantic Emperor?</p>
        
        <h4 class="name GEN-KOTEMK">GEN. KOTEMK.</h4><p class="speech"> You are quite right to call him romantic, Baron; a week ago
        I found him amusing himself in a garret with a company of strolling
        players; to-day his whim is all the convicts in Siberia are to be
        recalled, and political prisoners, as he calls them, amnestied.</p>
        
        <h4 class="name PRINCE-PETRO">PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p class="speech"> Political prisoners! Why, half of them are no better than
        common murderers!</p>
        
        <h4 class="name COUNT-R">COUNT R.</h4><p class="speech">And the other half much worse?</p>
        
        <h4 class="name BARON-RAFF">BARON RAFF.</h4><p class="speech"> Oh, you wrong them, surely, Count. Wholesale trade has
        always been more respectable than retail.</p>
        
        <h4 class="name COUNT-R">COUNT R.</h4><p class="speech"> But he is really too romantic. He objected yesterday to my
        having the monopoly of the salt tax. He said the people had a right to
        have cheap salt.</p>
        
        <h4 class="name MARQ-DE-POIV">MARQ. DE POIV.</h4><p class="speech"> Oh, that's nothing; but he actually disapproved of a
        State banquet every night because there is a famine in the Southern
        provinces.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction"> (_The young CZAR enters unobserved, and overhears the rest._)</p>
        
        <h4 class="name PRINCE-PETRO">PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p class="speech"> Quelle b√©tise! The more starvation there is among the
        people, the better. It teaches them self-denial, an excellent virtue,
        Baron, an excellent virtue.</p>
        
       <h4 class="name BARON-RAFF"> BARON RAFF.</h4><p class="speech"> I have often heard so; I have often heard so.</p>       
        
        <h4 class="name COUNT-R">COUNT R.</h4>
        <p class="stage-direction"> (_aside to BARON RAFF_).</p>
        <p class="speech"> Ah, to match the one Prince Paul gave
        her last week, I suppose.</p>
        
        <h4 class="name PRINCE-PETRO">PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p class="speech"> I must have sixty thousand roubles at once, Baron. My son
        is overwhelmed with debts of honour which he can't pay.</p>
        
        <h4 class="name BARON-RAFF">BARON RAFF.</h4><p class="speech"> What an excellent son to imitate his father so carefully!</p>
        
       <h4 class="name GEN-KOTEMK">GEN. KOTEMK.<h4><p class="speech"> You are always getting money. I never get a single kopeck I
        have not got a right to. It's unbearable; it's ridiculous! My nephew is
        going to be married. I must get his dowry for him.</p>
          
        <h4 class="name PRINCE-PETRO">PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p class="speech"> But my son, Baron?</p>
        
        <h4 class="name GEN-KOTEMK">GEN. KOTEMK.</h4><p class="speech"> But my nephew?</p>
        
        <h4 class="name MARQ-DE-POIV">MARQ. DE POIV.</h4><p> class="speech" But my house in town?</p>
        
        <h4 class="name COUNT-R">COUNT R.</h4><p class="speech">But my house in the country?</p>
        
        <h4 class="name MARQ-DE-POIV">MARQ. DE POIV.</h4><p class="speech">But my wife's diamond bracelet?</p>
        
        <h4 class="name BARON-RAFF">BARON RAFF.</h4><p class="speech"> Gentlemen, impossible! The old _regime_ in Russia is dead;
        the funeral begins to-day.</p>
        
        <h4 class="name COUNT-R">COUNT R.</h4><p class="speech"> Then I shall wait for the resurrection.</p>
        
        <h4 class="name PRINCE-PETRO">PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p class="speech"> Yes, but, _en attendant_, what are we to do?</p>
          
        <h4 class="name PRINCE-PETRO">PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p class="speech"> But do you think, Baron, that Prince Paul is really
        going?[3]</p>
        
        <h4 class="name BARON-RAFF">BARON RAFF.</h4><p class="speech"> He is exiled.</p>
        
        <h4 class="name PRINCE-PETRO">PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p class="speech"> Yes; but is he going?</p>
        
        <h4 class="name BARON-RAFF">BARON RAFF.</h4><p class="speech"> I am sure of it; at least he told me he had sent two
        telegrams already to Paris about his dinner.</p>
        
        <h4 class="name COUNT-R">COUNT R.</h4><p class="speech"> Ah! that settles the matter.</p>
        
       <h4 class="name CZAR">CZAR</h4><p class="stage-direction"> (_coming forward_).</p>
       <p class="speech"> Prince Paul better send a third telegram and
        order <P class="stage-direction">(_counting them_) </P><P class="speech">six extra places.</p>
