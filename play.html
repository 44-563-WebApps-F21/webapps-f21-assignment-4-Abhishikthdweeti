    <H2>ACT IV.

        SCENE.--_Antechamber of the CZAR'S private room. Large window at the
        back, with drawn curtains over it._
        
        _Present._--PRINCE PETROVITCH, BARON RAFF, MARQUIS DE POIVRARD, COUNT
        ROUVALOFF.
        
        
        <h4>PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p>He is beginning well, this young Czar.</p>
        
        <h4>BARON RAFF</h4><p> (_shrugs his shoulders_).</p>
        <p>All young Czars do begin well.</p>
        
        <h4>COUNT R.</h4><p> And end badly.</p>
        
        <h4>MARQ. DE POIV.</h4><p> Well, I have no right to complain. He has done me one
        good service, at any rate.</p>
        
        <h4>PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p>Cancelled your appointment to Archangel, I suppose?</p>
        
        <h4>MARQ. DE POIV.</h4><p> Yes; my head wouldn't have been safe there for an
        hour.</p>
        
        <p>(_Enter GENERAL KOTEMKIN._)</p>
        
        <h4>BARON RAFF.</h4><p> Ah! General, any more news of our romantic Emperor?</p>
        
        <h4>GEN. KOTEMK.</h4><p> You are quite right to call him romantic, Baron; a week ago
        I found him amusing himself in a garret with a company of strolling
        players; to-day his whim is all the convicts in Siberia are to be
        recalled, and political prisoners, as he calls them, amnestied.</p>
        
        <h4>PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p> Political prisoners! Why, half of them are no better than
        common murderers!</p>
        
        <h4>COUNT R.</h4><p>And the other half much worse?</p>
        
        <h4>BARON RAFF.</h4><p> Oh, you wrong them, surely, Count. Wholesale trade has
        always been more respectable than retail.</p>
        
        <h4>>COUNT R.</h4><p> But he is really too romantic. He objected yesterday to my
        having the monopoly of the salt tax. He said the people had a right to
        have cheap salt.</p>
        
        <h4>MARQ. DE POIV.</h4><p> Oh, that's nothing; but he actually disapproved of a
        State banquet every night because there is a famine in the Southern
        provinces.</p>
        <p> (_The young CZAR enters unobserved, and overhears the rest._)</p>
        
        <h4>PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p> Quelle b√©tise! The more starvation there is among the
        people, the better. It teaches them self-denial, an excellent virtue,
        Baron, an excellent virtue.</p>
        
       <h4> BARON RAFF.</h4><p> I have often heard so; I have often heard so.</p>       
        
        <h4>COUNT R.</h4>
        <p> (_aside to BARON RAFF_).</p>
        <p> Ah, to match the one Prince Paul gave
        her last week, I suppose.</p>
        
        <h4>PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p> I must have sixty thousand roubles at once, Baron. My son
        is overwhelmed with debts of honour which he can't pay.</p>
        
        <h4>BARON RAFF.</h4><p> What an excellent son to imitate his father so carefully!</p>
        
       <h4>GEN. KOTEMK.<h4><p> You are always getting money. I never get a single kopeck I
        have not got a right to. It's unbearable; it's ridiculous! My nephew is
        going to be married. I must get his dowry for him.</p>
          
        <h4>PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p> But my son, Baron?</p>
        
        <h4>GEN. KOTEMK.</h4><p> But my nephew?</p>
        
        <h4>MARQ. DE POIV.</h4><p> But my house in town?</p>
        
        <h4>COUNT R.</h4><p>But my house in the country?</p>
        
        <h4>MARQ. DE POIV.</h4><p>But my wife's diamond bracelet?</p>
        
        <h4>BARON RAFF.</h4><p> Gentlemen, impossible! The old _regime_ in Russia is dead;
        the funeral begins to-day.</p>
        
        <h4>COUNT R.</h4><p> Then I shall wait for the resurrection.</p>
        
        <h4>PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p> Yes, but, _en attendant_, what are we to do?</p>
          
        <h4>PRINCE PETRO.</h4><p> But do you think, Baron, that Prince Paul is really
        going?[3]</p>
        
        <h4>BARON RAFF.</h4><p> He is exiled.</p>
        
        PRINCE PETRO. Yes; but is he going?
        
        BARON RAFF. I am sure of it; at least he told me he had sent two
        telegrams already to Paris about his dinner.
        
        COUNT R. Ah! that settles the matter.
        
        CZAR (_coming forward_). Prince Paul better send a third telegram and
        order (_counting them_) six extra places.
        
   
        PRINCE PETRO. Sire, we did but jest.</H2>
